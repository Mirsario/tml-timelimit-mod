Time Limit does what it says on the tin. Worlds can now be set with time limits to have configurable events take place. For example, to run a timer for 5 minutes that exits the game on completion, type this into the chat or server console:

  /timerbegin 300 exit false

List of commands:
- 'timerbegin <seconds> <action> <repeat>' - Begins the timer with the given number of seconds before the given action is executed.
- 'timerend' - Aborts all currently running timers.

List of actions:
- 'none' - No action. Timer exists for show only.
- 'exit' - Exits the server/returns to menu.
- 'kill' - All players die.
- 'hardkill' - All players die as if in hardcore mode (i.e. permadeath).
- 'afflict' - All players receive a permanent affliction as specified in the config file's 'Afflictions' (de)buff list.
- <custom action name> - Same as 'none', unless another mod implements the named action via. API.

See the Hamstar's Helpers Control Panel for configuration options.
